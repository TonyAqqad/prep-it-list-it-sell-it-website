# UI/UX Rules

- Mobile-first design; ensure all CTAs are reachable on mobile.
- Tap targets: 44px minimum.
- Always include: skip link, focus rings, proper form labels, helpful errors.
- Prefer clear, short copy; avoid hype.
- Trust modules are reusable components (reviews, “family-owned”, response time).
