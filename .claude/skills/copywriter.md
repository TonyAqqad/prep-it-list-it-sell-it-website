# Copywriter Skill — 7-Step Conversion Framework

A systematic framework for writing high-converting page copy. Use this for landing pages, service pages, sales pages, and any content designed to drive action.

**Invoke this skill when:** Writing headlines, CTAs, landing pages, service descriptions, FAQs, or any conversion-focused copy.

## Step 1: Analyze Awareness Level

Before writing, determine where your reader is on the awareness spectrum:

| Level | Reader Knows | Headline Strategy |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Unaware** | Nothing about the problem | Lead with the problem, create urgency |
| **Problem-Aware** | They have a problem, not the solution | Agitate the pain, introduce your mechanism |
| **Solution-Aware** | Solutions exist, not yours specifically | Differentiate with unique mechanism |
| **Product-Aware** | Your offering, need convincing | Proof, objection handling, risk reversal |
| **Most Aware** | Ready to buy, need final push | Direct offer, authentic scarcity |

**Output:** State the awareness level and why before writing.

## Step 2: Headline — Fascination or Unique Mechanism

Choose ONE format:

### Fascination Format (curiosity-driven)
- "The [Unexpected Thing] That [Desirable Outcome]"
- "How [Specific Number] [People] [Achieved Result] Without [Expected Sacrifice]"
- "Why [Common Belief] Is Costing You [Specific Loss]"
- "The [Number] [Things] That [Negative Outcome] (And What To Do Instead)"

### Unique Mechanism Format (differentiation-driven)
- "How [Your Mechanism] [Delivers Outcome] Without [Competitor Weakness]"
- "The [Proprietary Name] Method: [Specific Benefit]"

**Rules:**
- Specific numbers beat vague claims
- Name the outcome, not the process
- 8-12 words ideal
- Test: Would this make someone stop scrolling?

---

## Step 3: Above-Fold CTA — Possessive & Benefit-Focused

### Possessive Language (ownership psychology)
- "Get YOUR Free Quote" (not "Get A Free Quote")
- "Start MY Consultation" (not "Start A Consultation")
- "Claim YOUR Spot" (not "Sign Up")

### Benefit-Focused (outcome, not action)
- "See How Much More You Could Get" (not "Request Estimate")
- "Find Out What Your Home Needs" (not "Contact Us")

### Structure
```
[Primary CTA Button — possessive, specific]
[Trust micro-copy — removes friction]

Example:
Get YOUR Free Quote
We respond within 1-24 hours. No obligation.
```

---

## Step 4: Proof — Specific Numbers & Dirty Laundry

### Specific Numbers Beat Vague Claims
| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Many satisfied customers" | "100+ homes prepared for sale" |
| "Fast response" | "Response within 1-24 hours" |
| "Great ROI" | "75-100% cost recovery" |
| "We're experienced" | "Family-owned since 2021" |

### Dirty Laundry Technique
Admit a small weakness to boost credibility on big claims:

> "We're not the cheapest option. We're not the biggest company. But we're the team that shows up when we say we will."

**Rules:**
- The weakness should be irrelevant to the core value proposition
- The weakness should make your strength more believable
- Never admit weakness in quality, ethics, or reliability

---

## Step 5: Body Copy — Slippery Slide & Seeds of Curiosity

### Slippery Slide Principle
Every sentence should compel reading the next one. Achieve this with:
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Pattern interrupts (bold, bullets, quotes)
- Open loops ("Here's the thing...")
- Questions that demand answers

### Seeds of Curiosity
Plant references to information coming later:
- "I'll explain why this matters in a moment"
- "But first, you need to understand..."
- "The real reason (which most people miss)..."

### Readability Rules
- 8th-10th grade reading level
- Active voice
- Concrete nouns over abstractions
- "You" more than "we"

---

## Step 6: FAQ = Objection Handling

Structure: **State Fear → Acknowledge → Redirect**

### Template
```
**"[Exact objection in customer's words]?"**
> [Acknowledge the concern as valid]
> [Provide evidence/logic to counter]
> [Redirect to benefit or next step]
```

### Example
```
**"Is it really worth updating before I sell?"**
> Fair question — especially if you're watching your bottom line.
> Here's what we've seen: homes with fresh updates spend less time on market. Less time means fewer price reductions.
> We'll tell you honestly what makes sense for your situation after we see the space.
```

### Common Objections to Address
1. Is it worth the cost/investment?
2. Will I get my money back?
3. How long will this take?
4. Can I trust you?
5. What if something goes wrong?
6. What if I have a tight timeline?

## Step 7: Bottom CTA — Restate Benefit & Authentic Scarcity

### Restate the Core Benefit
Don't introduce new information. Summarize the transformation:
- Where they are now (pain)
- Where they'll be after (outcome)
- The simple next step

### Authentic Scarcity Only
**Use if TRUE:**
- Limited capacity ("We take 4-6 projects at a time")
- Seasonal timing ("Spring listings fill our schedule fast")
- Deadline-driven ("Photos scheduled for next week?")

**NEVER fabricate:**
- Fake countdown timers
- False limited availability
- Artificial urgency

### Structure
```
**[Headline restating transformation]**

[1-2 sentences connecting pain → solution → outcome]

[Primary CTA — same as above-fold, possessive]

[Trust reinforcer — credentials, guarantee, response time]
```
