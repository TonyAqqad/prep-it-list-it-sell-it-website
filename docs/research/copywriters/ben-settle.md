## Core Philosophy: The "Email Players" Approach

### Daily Email Strategy

Ben believes anyone serious about email marketing should send at least one email per day, and every email should sell something.

**Why Daily Emails Work:**
- Readers get used to hearing from you and become part of their routine
- Instead of "Ugh, another email," they start to expect and look forward to your messages
- Consistent practice dramatically improves your writing skills
- Builds a relationship that makes selling natural rather than intrusive

**Practical Implementation:**
- Set a 20-minute writing timer per email
- Quality matters less than consistency
- Emails can be brief, conversational, and imperfect
- Be upfront about email frequency when subscribers join

### The "Talk Radio" Method

Treat your email list like a radio audience. Think of yourself as a talk radio host rather than an "email marketer."

**Core Principles:**
1. **Value Disguised as Entertainment** - The "broccoli hot dog" analogy: deliver nutritious information (broccoli) while making it enjoyable to consume (hot dog)
2. **Personality Over Authority** - Emphasize personality-driven communication rather than expertise-focused lectures
3. **Strategic Selling, Not Constant Pitching** - Like Rush Limbaugh's "profit center breaks" (commercials), take planned selling opportunities rather than pitching continuously
4. **Audience-Specific Communication** - Address a defined audience about shared passions, not everyone globally
5. **Storytelling and Entertainment First** - Focus on jokes, stories, and entertaining content rather than dry instruction

**Formula:** "You DO sell in every email, but you do it strategically."

## Anti-Guru, Contrarian Positioning

### The "Anti-Guru" Identity

Ben positions himself as someone who doesn't need to come off as a "guru." He describes himself as "kind of like an anti-guru."

**Contrarian Practices:**
- Mails his list every day (when most warn against this)
- Doesn't own a membership site
- Doesn't do social media
- Doesn't do marketing like most "Internet Marketing Gurus"
- Accepts that high unsubscribe rates aren't always bad

### Simplified Approach

Ben threw out "all the complicated 50+ point copywriting checklists, formulas, and templates all the gurus were pushing." Instead, he reverse-engineered how top copywriters structure their ads and broke it down into 5 easy steps.

**Core Belief:** "A copywriter is less about writing and more about knowing your market. The best copywriters aren't necessarily great 'writers' - they simply know their markets better than anyone else. They know what to say, which is far more important than how you say it."

---

## Building "Fanatics" Not Just Customers

### Polarization as Strategy

Ben uses polarization to build fierce loyalty among his true fans while naturally filtering out those who don't align.

**The "Hot or Cold" Principle:**
- You don't want anybody indifferent or lukewarm
- You want them either with you or against you
- Strong opinions and a clear voice attract your true fans
- Misaligned readers filter themselves out through unsubscribes

### Repulsion Marketing

Focus on repelling the people you don't want to attract the people you want by default.

**Key Insight:** When Ben priced his newsletter at $27/month, it attracted "lots of bottom feeders, price shoppers, and time wasters." His higher-priced Email Players newsletter (over 3x as expensive) has twice as many subscribers with far less cancellations and none of the bottom feeder drama.

**Application:** Try hard to REPEL flaky customers in your marketing from subscribing. Block at first slight so they become some other business' problem instead of yours.

### The Cult Following Effect

Ben builds loyalty through:
- Relentless, consistent daily emails attached to a brand
- Being extremely reclusive yet generating fierce loyalty from subscribers
- Story-led approaches (like how David Lynch built a cult film following)
- Creating audience trust so they willingly purchase when timing and relevance align

**His Admission:** "My methods are mostly slow & tedious... and it could be months before you see results. But, they've helped me build one of the most responsive email lists of loyal, eager-to-buy & quick-to-refer leads in my industry."

## Infotainment Style (Information + Entertainment)

### The Core Concept

"It's all about infotainment - combining entertainment with information. People are easily bored. Attention spans are dropping like a politician's pants at a brothel. If you don't make your content fun, you're dead in the water."

### Practical Application

**Instead of:** "7 ways to lose weight"
**Write:** "7 ways Yoda would lose weight if he was getting a little heavier"

### Benefits of Infotainment

- Generates sales, happy customers, and opportunities to help your market
- Bonds them to your business in ways boring competition cannot touch
- Makes readers forget they're reading an advertisement
- Keeps them too busy enjoying good content to resist the pitch

### The Fun Factor

Ben defines "fun" not as slapstick entertainment, but as genuinely enjoying your content while helping subscribers who want what you're selling. This enjoyment transfers to readers.

**If you're not enjoying writing about a certain topic, throw it out and write about something else.** People can sense boredom, and they won't tolerate it - especially in email where they have 500 other emails competing for attention.

## Polarizing Copy That Repels and Attracts

### Why Polarization Works

- Being polarizing gets attention, and attention is the currency of email copywriting
- Most copywriters play it safe with vanilla opinions
- Ben does the opposite - deliberately takes strong stances
- People who resonate become fiercely loyal; others are filtered out

### The 3X Method

Take your natural personality and crank it up three notches:
- If you're a little sarcastic, be way more sarcastic
- If you're blunt, be brutally blunt
- If you're laid-back, be super chill

**Goal:** Make your personality so distinct that readers can't mistake you for anyone else.

### Practical Polarization Tactics

1. Express bold, unapologetic opinions
2. Include a call-to-action or pitch in every message
3. Use strong opinions to naturally filter out non-ideal prospects
4. Never apologize for selling
5. Make your style unmistakable

### Selling to Skeptics

"We live in the age of the skeptic. Everyone has been screwed over by someone and so are rightfully skeptical."

**Key Insight:** In most markets, only about 5% are hyper buyers, but there are 2-5 times more skeptics. If you know how to sell to skeptics, you will get 2-5 times more sales than copywriters who don't.

## Selling Without Being "Salesy"

### The Core Approach

Ben sells the relationship, which gets the clicks that lead to sales. You get it by:
- Sending the right kind of emails
- With the right kind of intent
- In just the right volume/frequency
- With the right message, to the right person, at the right time

### Entertainment-Based Selling

- Make every email entertaining, even when it's blatantly selling something
- Use humor, sarcasm, or storytelling to keep readers entertained
- Weave in your offer so naturally that it doesn't feel like a hard sell
- Let readers enjoy the ride so they don't mind the sales pitch

**Recognition from David Deutsch:** "Ben's emails are PERFECT examples of how to sell with email... how to be a welcome guest in someone's inbox rather than a persistent pest... how to sell with story... and how to create a persona that draws people to you."

### Ethical Obligation to Sell

Ben frames daily selling as an ethical obligation: "If you have a solution that you know in your heart is going to help somebody," you should make it available daily.

**He calls avoiding selling "incredibly selfish"** - if you can help someone, you owe it to them to offer that help.

## Personality Injection Methods

### Write Like You Talk

- Use casual, conversational language as if chatting with a friend
- Forget about formal structure
- Forget about proper grammar
- Forget about trying to sound "professional"
- Treat everything you write like it's sales copy

### The Conversational Style

- Short, choppy sentences
- One or two word paragraphs helping break up the page
- Easy-to-digest language that sounds like you're talking, not writing
- Words that induce emotion, image, and belief - instead of just cold, hard logic

### Vary Sentence and Paragraph Length

Ben switches between:
- One-liners
- Short paragraphs
- Occasional longer blocks of text

This rhythm keeps readers moving through the email without feeling overwhelmed. People skim emails - this format accommodates that.

### Being Raw and Real

- Don't worry about being "professional"
- Focus on being relatable and real
- Pack emails with personality, humor, and the occasional rant
- This raw, conversational style makes messages feel human

## Key Formulas and Techniques

### The 5-Step Sales Letter Formula

Ben's "dumbed down" million-dollar sales letter structure:

#### Step 1: Headline
- Stop the scroll and hook the reader ("the greased chute")
- Tap into existing pain, desire, or curiosity
- Promise a clear benefit or outcome
- Feel specific and relevant to the target audience
- Be emotionally charged (fear, greed, vanity, etc.)

**Formula:** "How to [get result] Without [painful thing]"

#### Step 2: Lead
- Use "If...then..." structure to demonstrate understanding
- Dive straight into buyer psychology and emotional triggers
- Take them from pain to possibility in a single breath
- Hint at product benefits without revealing everything
- Keep tension and create curiosity

**Example:** "If you've been writing decent copy but still hearing crickets from clients... then it's not your writing that's the problem."

#### Step 3: Story
- Build trust, emotion, and momentum
- Make the reader feel something
- Bridge the gap between current struggle and desired outcome
- Can be personal narratives, customer transformations, or "day in the life" scenarios

#### Step 4: Bullets
- Each bullet is a "mini headline"
- Focus on outcomes rather than features
- Trigger curiosity
- Highlight specific benefits

**Example:** "The 10-minute video that shows you how to instantly flip your 'low rates' excuse into a high-fee advantage."

#### Step 5: Close
- Clear call-to-action telling them exactly what to do
- Recap core benefits
- Create urgency
- Offer risk reversal (money-back guarantees)
- Final emotional push for immediate action
- Ask for the sale clearly, confidently, without flinching

**Critical Warning:** The biggest mistake is getting shy, going soft, hedging, or tiptoeing around the CTA like you're apologizing for selling.

### Subject Line Techniques

**The #1 Rule:** "Don't write anything that looks like anything else anyone else is writing." Copy & paste swiping is "utterly stupid."

**Curiosity-Driven Approach:**
- Tease just enough to make readers think, "I have to know what this is about"
- Hint at a secret or surprising twist
- Never give everything away upfront

**Secret Weapon:** Old comic book ads - many can make writing subject lines, blog titles, and PPC ads faster and easier.

### 12 Bullet Point Secrets

1. **Curiosity** - Wrench on your prospect's natural sense of curiosity ("Curiosity is an even more powerful buying motive than desire" - Gary Halbert)
2. **Almost Unbelievable** - Say something 100% true but so whacky it makes you say, "How in the heck can you do that?"
3. **Proof and Credibility** - Add credibility to claims
4. **Contrasting Ideas** - Use contrast to highlight benefits
5. **Pain Points** - Mention physical or psychological pain
6. **Straight Benefits** - Direct benefit statements
7. **What NOT to Do** - Tell readers what to avoid
8. **Give Away Secrets** - Occasionally reveal the whole secret (builds believability)
9. **The 90% Solution** - Leave out 10% of the solution (creates curiosity)
10. **Dramatic Sub-headlines** - Turn last 6-7 words of bullet into a dramatic sub-headline
11. **Compressed Bullets** - Compress multiple short, punchy bullets into a single paragraph as a "grand finale"
12. **Expanded Bullets** - Detailed explanations of key points

### Storytelling Framework

**Core Technique:** Lead with the story, then naturally transition into your pitch.

**Why Stories Work:**
- Readers don't feel like they're being sold to - they're along for the ride
- Stories stick and activate the brain in ways pure information can't
- When people relate to your story, they remember your message and offer
- Stories humanize you, building trust

**Ben's Crib Sheet for Storytelling:**
1. Write an email each and every day telling a story designed to sell your offers until it becomes second nature
2. Study all Gary Halbert ads with stories - copy them out by hand
3. Do the same with John Carlton ads and Scott Haines ads
4. What you leave out is far more important than what you leave in
5. Nothing teaches storytelling better than telling stories everywhere until it becomes second nature

## The Villain Concept

### Marketing as Villain

Ben has written multiple books on using "villain" psychology in marketing:
- "Persuasion Secrets of the World's Most Charismatic & Influential Villains"
- "Super Villains of Persuasion"

**Core Concept:** "I want you to start thinking of villains as people who are against the established order of things. If you want to make a difference in your market and even in the world, you should stop being a nice guy and start behaving like a villain."

### Studying Competition

By studying enemies/competition, you always know their "Achilles heel" and the "crack" in their armor. This keeps competition "quaking in their boots."

**Application:** Study your competition. Look for the "tender spots" in their sales and marketing funnels. This is like putting on your own Kryptonite ring - even bigger, stronger, more cash-flush competitors can't touch you.

## Application for Home Improvement/Listing Prep Website

### Recommended Adaptations

1. **Daily/Regular Email Cadence** - Even seasonal businesses (like pool cleaning) can email year-round about related topics, building authority before busy seasons

2. **Soft Teaching Approach** - For service businesses, discuss benefits and symptoms without giving away proprietary methods

3. **Personality-Driven Content** - Inject owner/company personality into all communications using the 3X Method

4. **Polarizing Positioning** - Take strong stances on home prep best practices, what sellers should avoid, industry problems

5. **Infotainment Topics** - Transform standard home prep advice into entertaining content (e.g., "What Game of Thrones can teach you about staging your home")

6. **Story-Based Selling** - Lead with transformation stories from past clients, neighborhood case studies, personal experiences

7. **Strategic Repulsion** - Clearly communicate who is NOT a good fit to attract ideal clients (serious sellers vs. tire-kickers)

8. **Curiosity-Driven Headlines** - Use bullet point secrets for service descriptions and email subject lines

9. **Ethical Selling Frame** - Position services as helping homeowners get their deserved value, making selling a service to them

10. **Trust Through Consistency** - Build the cult following effect through regular, personality-rich communication
