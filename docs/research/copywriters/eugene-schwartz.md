# Eugene Schwartz Copywriting Techniques

> "Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already existing desires onto a particular product."

Eugene Schwartz (1927-1995) was one of the highest-paid copywriters in history, with an 85% "hit ratio" for winning ads. His 1966 book *Breakthrough Advertising* remains the definitive text on understanding market psychology and writing persuasive copy.

## Core Philosophy: Channeling Desire

Schwartz's foundational insight: **You cannot create desire. You can only channel it.**

The power that makes advertising work comes from the market itself, not from the copy. The copywriter's job is to:

1. Identify the pre-existing desires in your market
2. Acknowledge and reinforce those desires
3. Focus and direct those desires onto your specific product

### The Three-Step Formula for Channeling Desire

1. **Choose** the most powerful desire that applies to your product
2. **Acknowledge** that desire, reinforce it, and offer the means to satisfy it in your headline
3. **Connect** your product's performances to the satisfaction of that desire

## The 5 Levels of Market Awareness

Understanding where your prospect sits on the awareness spectrum determines your entire copy approach. Move from most aware (easiest to sell) to unaware (hardest).

### Level 1: Most Aware

**Definition:** The prospect knows your product, knows what it does, knows they want it. They just haven't bought yet.

**Headline Strategy:**
- Minimal copy needed
- Focus on: product name, price, special offer, urgency
- Direct call to action

**Example Approach:** "Prep It List It Sell It - Now Booking January. Call Today for Your Free Estimate"

---

### Level 2: Product Aware

**Definition:** Prospect knows your product exists but isn't convinced it's right for them.

**Headline Strategy:** Accomplish one of seven tasks:
1. Reinforce desire
2. Sharpen the image of your product
3. Extend the application (new uses)
4. Introduce new proof
5. Announce a new mechanism
6. Eliminate perceived limitations
7. Differentiate from competition

**Copy Focus:** Features, benefits, testimonials, proof, and comparisons

---

### Level 3: Solution Aware

**Definition:** Prospect knows solutions exist to their problem but doesn't know your specific product provides it.

**Headline Strategy:** Three-step approach:
1. Name the desire/problem vividly
2. Prove it can be solved
3. Position your product as THE answer

**Copy Focus:** Demonstrate superiority and differentiation from alternatives

---

### Level 4: Problem Aware

**Definition:** Prospect recognizes they have a problem but doesn't know solutions exist.

**Headline Strategy:** Problem-Agitation-Solution (PAS):
1. Name the problem
2. Dramatize it vividly (agitate the pain)
3. Present your product as the inevitable solution

**Copy Focus:** Validate their pain, educate on possibilities, introduce your solution

---

### Level 5: Unaware

**Definition:** Prospect doesn't even recognize they have a problem.

**Headline Strategy:**
- Never mention product, price, or direct claims
- Echo an emotion or attitude they identify with
- Call out the market itself
- Create identification first, education second

**Copy Focus:** Indirect approach through storytelling, emotional connection, or revealing hidden problems

---

## The 5 Stages of Market Sophistication

Market sophistication measures how many similar products/claims your prospect has seen. This determines HOW you make your claims.

### Stage 1: First to Market

**Situation:** You're introducing something new that nobody has seen before.

**Strategy:**
- Be simple and direct
- State the claim plainly in the headline
- Dramatize the claim in copy
- Prove it works

**Formula:** "Do [desired outcome] with [product]"

---

### Stage 2: Competition Enters

**Situation:** Competitors offer similar solutions. The market knows the category.

**Strategy:**
- Expand on your claims with more proof
- Focus on your "big promise"
- Emphasize what makes you better, faster, stronger

**Formula:** "[Better/Faster/More] than [competitor approach]"

---

### Stage 3: Market Crowding

**Situation:** Customers have heard all the claims. They're skeptical.

**Strategy:**
- Introduce a **unique mechanism** - the "how" behind your claims
- Explain WHY your product works where others don't
- Provide the "secret" or "system"

**Formula:** "The [unique mechanism] that [delivers result]"

**Key Concept - Unique Mechanism:** The mysterious secret behind why a product works. Instead of telling what you do, explain how you do it.

---

### Stage 4: Market Saturation

**Situation:** Even unique mechanisms have been copied. Everything is crowded.

**Strategy:**
- Elaborate and improve on existing mechanisms
- Do side-by-side comparisons
- Highlight features competitors don't have
- Refresh and reframe your positioning

**Formula:** "The [improved mechanism] with [differentiating feature]"

---

### Stage 5: Complete Market Exhaustion

**Situation:** Nobody buys into direct advertising. They know everything.

**Strategy:**
- Shift from WHAT you sell to WHY you sell it
- Focus on identity, values, and emotional connection
- Build the brand around who your customers want to become
- Use storytelling, not product features

**Formula:** "For [identity/values-based descriptor] who [aspiration]"

---

## Headline Strategy by Awareness Level

### The Three Questions Before Writing Any Headline

1. What is the **mass desire** that motivates your market?
2. What is their **State of Awareness**? (How much do they know about your product?)
3. What is their **State of Sophistication**? (How many similar products have they seen?)

### Headline Formulas by Awareness Level

| Awareness Level | Headline Focus | Example Structure |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Most Aware | Product name + offer | "[Product] - [Special Offer/Price]" |
| Product Aware | Differentiation/proof | "Why [Target] Choose [Product] Over [Alternative]" |
| Solution Aware | Superior solution | "The [Mechanism] Way to [Desired Outcome]" |
| Problem Aware | Problem → solution | "[Pain Point]? Here's How to [Solution]" |
| Unaware | Identification/curiosity | "[Provocative Statement/Question That Resonates]" |

## 13 Techniques for Intensifying Desire

The goal is to overcome skepticism, lethargy, and price resistance through presenting fresh fulfillments of the prospect's dominant desire.

### 1. First Presentation of Claims
Present the product or its results directly with thorough, detailed description of appearance or results.

### 2. Put Claims in Action
Show not only what benefits you provide, but exactly HOW the product delivers them. Mechanism in motion.

### 3. Bring In the Reader
Put the prospect in the middle of the product-in-action story. Give them a verbal demonstration of what happens the first day they use your service.

**Example:** "Picture this: You wake up Monday morning. The painting crew has finished. You walk through your home and see..."

### 4. Show Them How to Test Claims
Let readers visualize themselves proving the product's performance, gaining benefits immediately in specific, dramatic ways.

### 5. Stretch Out Benefits in Time
Illustrate benefits across weeks, months, and years - not just immediate results. Create a "continuous flow of benefits."

### 6. Bring In an Audience
Introduce third-party perspectives through testimonials, statistics, and success stories.

### 7. Show Experts Approving
Feature professionals and specialists registering approval (not just celebrities or regular users).

### 8. Compare, Contrast, Prove Superiority
Highlight disadvantages of the old approach alongside advantages of the new. Show why your way is better than the alternative.

### 9. Picture the Black Side (Heaven-or-Hell)
Present the problem vividly, then position your product as the solution. Show what happens if they DON'T act.

### 10. Show How Easy It Is
Emphasize simplicity regarding price, use, process, timeline, and all customer touchpoints.

### 11. Use Metaphor, Analogy, Imagination
Employ figurative language to represent facts more dramatically while remaining truthful.

### 12. Summarize Before Finishing
List benefits and deliverables in bullets or narrative form, refreshing earlier claims one final time.

### 13. Put Your Guarantee to Work
Transform the guarantee into the climax - a final summary of product performance reinforced by that guarantee. Use it to hit them one more time with benefits.

## 7 Body Copy Techniques

### 1. Intensification
Present multiple fresh fulfillments of the dominant desire through varied presentation methods (action, reader involvement, expert validation, comparison, metaphor).

### 2. Identification
Position the product as enabling desired social roles or status. Build a bridge between the customer's current self and their aspirational self-image.

**For Home Improvement:** Connect with the identity of "savvy seller," "prepared homeowner," or "smart investor in their property."

### 3. Gradualization
Layer claims sequentially, building a logical foundation for each subsequent statement. Prepare reader acceptance through step-by-step reasoning.

### 4. Redefinition
Reframe product perception through:
- **Simplification:** Reduce complexity perception
- **Escalation:** Broaden benefits
- **Price reframing:** Compare to a different standard

### 5. Mechanization
Explain HOW the product delivers results. Name, describe, or feature the mechanism depending on market sophistication.

### 6. Concentration
Highlight competitor weaknesses. Use parallel or before/after structures comparing old solutions to yours.

### 7. Camouflage
Present copy in editorial format for credibility. Use:
- News tone
- Industry jargon
- Understated language
- Acknowledge limitations ("deadly sincerity")

## Mass Desire: Identification and Research

### Definition
"Mass desire" = The public spread of a private want. A group of individuals who all share a common need or desire.

### The Three Dimensions of Mass Desire

Evaluate potential desires across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | Scoring |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Urgency/Intensity** | How big is the pain? How badly do they want to solve it? | Higher = Better |
| **Staying Power** | How often do they feel this pain? How hard is it to satisfy permanently? | Recurring = Better |
| **Market Size** | How many people share this desire? | Larger = Better |

### Two Categories of Desire Forces

**Permanent Forces (Always Present):**
- Desire to achieve
- Desire to be attractive
- Desire to be healthy
- Desire to be better than neighbors
- Need to solve specific problems

**Forces of Change (Trend-Based):**
- Fashion and style
- Lifestyle choices
- Displays of wealth/status
- Current events and cultural shifts

### Research Method: Product-to-Desire Mapping

1. **Identify all performances** your product/service contains
2. **List all desires** each performance could satisfy
3. **Rate each desire** across the three dimensions
4. **Select the ONE desire** with maximum sales power for your current market moment

**Key Insight:** Every product appeals to 2-4 mass desires, but you can only use ONE in your headline. This choice is the most important step in the entire copywriting process.

## The Schwartz Writing Process

### The 33:33 Timer Technique

Schwartz's daily writing routine:
- **Duration:** 3-3.5 hours per day, 5 days per week
- **Method:** Set a timer for 33 minutes and 33 seconds
- **Rules during the timer:**
  - You CAN: Drink coffee, stare out the window, do nothing, or write
  - You CANNOT: Leave the chair or do anything else
- **When timer ends:** Stop (even mid-sentence), take a 10-15 minute break
- **Repeat:** 5-6 sessions per day

### The Research-First Philosophy

> "Copy is not written. Copy is assembled."

Schwartz's approach:
- **80-90% of work is research** before writing begins
- Read, re-read, and re-re-read everything about the product
- Systematically mark down benefits as stated by the creator
- Look for the "golden nugget" competitors missed

### Key Principles

1. **Never "create" - connect:** "Creation means making something out of nothing. Let's throw creation out and talk about connectivity. What you're trying to do is connect things together."

2. **Let the subconscious work:** Breakthrough ideas come while shaving, showering, or making coffee - when focused on something unrelated.

3. **Be the best listener:** "Talk little, listen much."

4. **Analysis over formulas:** "In a field where forces are constantly shifting, formulas simply will not work. They must be replaced by analysis."
