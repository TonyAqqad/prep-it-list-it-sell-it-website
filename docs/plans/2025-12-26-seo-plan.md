### Painting

| Question | Answer Summary |
|----------|----------------|
| Should I paint before selling my house? | Yes — fresh paint is the #1 ROI improvement, returning 100%+ on investment. |
| What colors sell houses faster? | Neutral tones: warm whites, light grays, greige. Avoid bold or personal colors. |
| Is exterior painting worth it before selling? | Yes, if paint is peeling or faded. First impressions matter — curb appeal sells. |
| How much does pre-sale painting cost? | Interior: $2-4/sq ft. Exterior: $3-6/sq ft. ROI typically exceeds 100%. |

### Flooring

| Question | Answer Summary |
|----------|----------------|
| Should I replace carpet before selling? | If it's stained, worn, or outdated — yes. Clean, neutral carpet or LVP sells homes. |
| What flooring has the best ROI before selling? | Luxury vinyl plank (LVP) offers best value: durable, attractive, cost-effective. |
| Is hardwood worth it before selling? | Only if budget allows. LVP gives a similar look at lower cost with excellent ROI. |

### Handyman

| Question | Answer Summary |
|----------|----------------|
| What repairs should I make before selling? | Fix visible issues: leaky faucets, squeaky doors, cracked tiles, drywall holes. |
| What not to fix when selling a house? | Major renovations, cosmetic issues buyers won't notice, personal preference items. |

| How important is curb appeal when selling? | Critical — 94% of realtors say curb appeal is important for attracting buyers. |

| Should I landscape before selling? | Basic cleanup and fresh mulch: yes. Major landscaping projects: usually no. |

### Cleaning

| Question | Answer Summary |
|----------|----------------|
| Should I deep clean before selling? | Absolutely. A clean home signals "well-maintained" and photographs better. |

### Decluttering

| Question | Answer Summary |

| Question | Answer Summary |
|----------|----------------|
| Is home staging worth it? | Staged homes sell 73% faster and for 5-10% more on average. |
| Home staging vs home improvement — which is better? | Both. Fix issues first, then stage. Staging a poorly maintained home doesn't work. |
